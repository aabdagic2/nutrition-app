# Nutrition app

For personal use, I developed a nutrition app that utilizes the Edamame API. It allows you to search, filter, and view recipes that align with your diet preferences or allergies. If you signup, you can save your recipes to the library, and add items to shopping cart.

## Login and Signup

In my app, the authentication process involves both login and signup functionalities. For secure user authentication, I implemented JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The signup process has been simplified to provide a straightforward and user-friendly experience, ensuring a quick and efficient onboarding for new users. After signing up, users can seamlessly log in using their credentials, enjoying a secure and efficient authentication mechanism powered by JSON Web Tokens.

## Recipe details

When you click on a recipe card, it opens a new page displaying the recipe details. Here, users have the option to add ingredients to their shopping list. Additionally, clicking the "add to shopping cart" icon automatically includes the recipe in their library if it hasn't been added before.

## Library

In the Library section, recipes are presented as cards for easy navigation and exploration. Users can utilize the search feature to find specific recipes within the library. Furthermore, users have the ability to access and view their shopping carts directly from this section, providing a convenient and centralized experience for managing recipes and shopping preferences.
